# SimilarityMeasure
SimilarityMeasure - compute for one node in a graph the most similar one

## Build
To build SimilarityMeasure you need a C++11 Compiler and the development package for libcurl. For me this is [libcurl4-openssl-dev](https://packages.debian.org/de/sid/libcurl4-openssl-dev).
Please use the g++ Compiler for C++ Version 11.

## Run

similarityMeasure [indexFileLocation/IndexFileName]

## Index Files
You need an index out of a .map and a .data file (examples are available below). You have to store the files in the same folder with the same name.

You can download sample index files from Wikidata under following urls:
